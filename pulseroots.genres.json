IDM blends elements of ambient, techno, and drum and bass with intricate, often unconventional beats and intricate melodies, creating a sound that is both cerebral and emotionally expressive. Unlike mainstream dance music, which focuses on maintaining a consistent groove for the dancefloor, IDM is more about pushing the boundaries of sound and rhythm, using glitchy effects, irregular time signatures, and abstract compositions. The genre often features atmospheric soundscapes, intricate layers of synths, and sampled sounds. IDM is intended to be listened to and appreciated as much for its innovative production as for its potential to be danced to. Pioneering artists of IDM include Autechre, Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, and Boards of Canada.",

This genre often conveys a sense of nostalgia for early digital sounds or critiques our relationship with technology by exposing its flaws. Post-digital music tends to be minimalistic and abstract, highlighting the aesthetics of failure and the beauty of digital artifacts, and it’s closely related to glitch and experimental electronic music.
